# Introduction

This repository accompanies the EMNLP 2024 position paper [Advancing Social Intelligence in AI Agents: Technical Challenges and Open Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11023) by [Leena Mathur](https://l-mathur.github.io/), [Paul Liang](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pliang/), and [Louis-Philippe Morency](https://lti.cmu.edu/people/faculty/morency-louis-philippe.html) from the [Language Technologies Institute](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu) and [Machine Learning Department](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/) at CMU. 

The [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11023) identifies a set of underlying technical challenges, opportunities, and open questions for researchers across computing communities to advance Social-AI. The paper is anchored in social intelligence concepts and prior work in Social-AI across 6 computing communities: natural language processing, machine learning, robotics, human-machine interaction, computer vision, and speech.

  <em>(A) Four core technical challenges in Social-AI research, illustrated in an example context of a Social-AI agent observing and learning from a human-human interaction. (B) The landscape of social contexts in which Social-AI agents can be situated, spanning interaction dimensions/structures, social settings, degrees of agent embodiment, and social attributes of humans, with agents in several roles.</em>

**C1: Ambiguity in Constructs** (Section 4.1 of the paper)

*Social constructs have inherent ambiguity in their definition and interpretation in the social world.* 

**C2: Nuanced Signals** (Section 4.2 of the paper)

*Social constructs are expressed through behaviors and signals that can be nuanced, often manifesting through different degrees of synchrony across actors and modalities. During interactions, small changes in social signals can lead to large shifts in social meaning being conveyed.* 

**C3: Multiple Perspectives** (Section 4.3 of the paper)

*In social interactions, actors bring their own perspectives, experiences, and roles; these factors can change over time and influence the perspectives of other actors during interactions.* 

**C4: Agency and Adaptation** (Section 4.4 of the paper)

*Actors learn from social experiences and adapt to social contexts, through interactions, influenced by their own agency, goals, motivations, and identities.*

## Dimensions of Social Context, Additional Concepts, and Frameworks
Social-AI agents can be situated within interactions spanning social units, interaction structures, and timescales. Interactions can span social settings, degrees of agent embodiment, and social attributes of humans, with agents in several roles.
